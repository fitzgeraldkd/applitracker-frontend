## Purpose

The purpose of this app is to give job-seekers a tool to help track where they've applied to and the status of their applications. 

The user can create a new account, or sign into an existing account. They can add jobs that they've applied to and see the full list of all their applications. 

Each job can be labelled with a status of the application (such as pending for when the company is reviewing your application, or interviewing once you're scheduling a time to meet). 

A calendar page is also provided so the user can list scheduled interview dates or application deadlines for their own reference. Each event is tied to a specific job application.

## Installation (Local)

> Before running the front-end, make sure the back-end server is running (see instructions in the [back-end repository's README](https://github.com/fitzgeraldkd/applitracker-backend)).

First install all the required modules by running this command in your terminal: 

```bash
npm install
```

Then the React app can be started with this command:

```bash
npm start
```

It should automatically open a new tab in your default browser.
